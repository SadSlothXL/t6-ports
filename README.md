# t6-ports
A collection of T6 (BO2) ports by me

- Download the lastest version of OAT [here](https://github.com/Laupetin/OpenAssetTools)

- Use my dump and build bat to make dumping and building easier 
(you will need to edit these with your paths).

- Dump the zones that are ignored in the zone source file e.g `code_post_gfx_mp`, `common_mp` `common_patch_mp`

- Once dumped move their zone source files into your `zone_source` folder.

- You should now be able to build one of my weapons

- When built a new folder will be created called `zone_out` this is where the .ff (fastfile), IWD and .sabl will be.
*Note: The current version of OAT (v0.24.1) cant build xanims into the .ff so you will need to move the xanim folder into the IWD*
